          Are children allowed?
          <span className="answers">
          Unfortunately due to space limitations, the only children attending are those of family and will be reflected in the RSVP. We appreciate you making arrangements ahead of time and leaving the kids at home so you can celebrate with us.

          Can I bring a guest to your wedding?
          <span className="answers">
          Due to the intimate nature of our wedding, we cannot accommodate for every guest to bring a guest of their own. Therefore, we ask our lovely guests to not bring a plus, unless they are specifically named on the invitation. Thank you so much for understanding!

          What should I wear? Is there a dress code?
          <span className="answers">
          The dress code for our wedding is semi-formal/cocktail attire.  Ladies should wear cocktail or party dresses, and the gentlemen should wear a suit and tie or a sports coat. However, if you want to full-on formal it out, don't let us stop you! We want you to feel confident and snazzy!

          Will the ceremony and reception be indoors or outdoors?
          <span className="answers">
          Both will be held indoors, although, November in the DFW area can be very temperamental. You may want a light coat/blazer.

        Can I take and post pictures of the wedding on social media?
          <span className="answers">
          Of course! Since we're not famous and will not be featured in People Magazine, we encourage guests to post pictures to social media! Our only request is that you tag each photo with our wedding hashtag #theshawchengredemption so we can keep track of all of your pictures!‚Äù
